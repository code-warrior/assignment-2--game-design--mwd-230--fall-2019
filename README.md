# Fall 2019 Game Design — Assignment 2 (Reading and background rendering)

* **Do not edit this file.**  
* **Do not start this project until you have read these instructions carefully.**

## Introduction
This assignment is broken down into two parts: 1) answering questions from the readings, and 2) generating two environment backgrounds, including obstacles, in which the creature from your first assignment lives.

## Before You Begin
1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Fork this repo(sitory). See [this video](http://code-warrior.github.io/tutorials/git/github/forking-and-cloning-at-the-github-web-site/) on how to carry out this step and step `3`.
3. Clone your fork, using either the web site or the GitHub Desktop client.
4. Checkout your personalized branch, the one with your name and GitHub user handle.

## Programming
* Using Processing, open the `sketch` folder in this repo. Do all your work in this sketch and do not rename the folder or its containing `.pde` file.
* Create a canvas that is `1280 × 800`.
* Add your creature from assignment 1, complete with keyboard bindings.
* Render a background in the canvas using **only** Processing’s primitives (no images).
* Add 5 obstacles using **only** images (no primitives) to the first background. **You must have the right to use those images.**
* Render a second background in the canvas using **only** one or more images (no primitives). **You must have the right to use those images.**
* Add 5 obstacles using **only** Processing’s primitives (no images) to the second background.
* Assign the keyboard’s letter ”F” to enable the first background.
* Assign the keyboard’s letter ”S” to enable the second background.

## Questions from Readings
For the following five questions, include your answers between the set of backticks under each question.
